# ChoralRoot FM-1: settings persistence

Files: `firmware/src/cr_settings.h` (the record), `firmware/src/cr_settings.c` (import / apply / capture, and
in the firmware unit the flash side and the UI glue), `firmware/src/settings_persist.c` (Felucca's record,
now PER5), `tests/cr_settings_test.c`, the emulator's flash in `tools/emu/emu_hal_fw.h` and `tools/emu/emu_fw.c`,
and `tools/emu/test_persist.sh`.

## Where it lives

Felucca keeps one flash object, `OBJ_SETTINGS`: an A/B sector pair at 0xFC000 / 0xFD000 (`storage.c`). Each
copy has a commit record with a sequence number and a CRC, so a torn write leaves the older copy in charge. Its
payload is `persist_t` (`settings_persist.c`), whose magic marks the layout version:

| magic | adds |
| --- | --- |
| PER1, PER2 | upstream: palette, lowcut, panel table |
| PER3 | `bold` (HOLD now lives there) |
| PER4 | favorites |
| **PER5** | **`cr_settings_t cr`: ChoralRoot's block, 192 bytes, last** |

A PER1 to PER4 record imports as before, and its `cr` block is zeroed. A zeroed block fails the block's magic,
so the ChoralRoot side reads defaults. A Felucca build (`felucca.c` → `project.c`) keeps the block exactly as
saved. Felucca's own fields stay where they were: the panel calibration table, the palette, HOLD in `bold`, and
LEDs in `zoom`.

## The ChoralRoot block (`cr_settings_t`, `CRS_SIZE` = 192 bytes)

The block has its own header:

- `magic` `CRS1`
- `version` (`CRS_VERSION`, currently 6)
- `size` (the writer's `CRS_SIZE`)
- `check`: FNV-1a over bytes 12..size

| usb_in (v4) | Options > **USB Record**: ChoralRoot In is presented to the computer (docs/USB-AUDIO.md); Off: the serial console instead | **1** (on); a v1..v3 record takes it (its zero would mean off) |
| usb_level (v4) | Options > USB Level: `CRS_USB_MASTER` (the recording follows MASTER) / `CRS_USB_FIXED` (recorded at the full level, MASTER after) | Master |
| pool_pos[2][10], pool_pos10_chord, pool_pos10_bass (v6) | per part (chord, bass), per engine (`ENGINE_ORDER` rank 0..9 in `pool_pos`, rank 10 in the two bytes that were `rsv0` / `rsv1`; `crs_pool_get` / `crs_pool_set`): the pool position last played there, where OPT + PRESETS lands; 0..127, checked against the pool by the glue | 1 (each engine's first preset); a v1..v5 record takes the defaults |

The reserve is used up by v6 (`rsv[20]` became `pool_pos`): the next field needs a longer record (a new PER magic or
a larger `CRS_SIZE` with the import rules for a shorter one).

### Import rules (`cr_settings_import`)

`cr_settings_import` returns 1 for a current record, 2 for a migrated one, and 0 when it falls back to defaults.

1. **No defaults path:** an absent or short block, a bad magic, version 0, a size that does not fit, or a bad
   checksum gives **all defaults**. It never loops and never hangs; the test feeds it 2000 garbage blocks.
2. **Older record:** an older version, or a shorter size, is copied over the defaults. Any field it lacks keeps
   its default.
3. **Newer record:** a newer, longer record (a downgrade) keeps its first 192 bytes, which hold our fields.
4. **Range check:** every field is checked against its range. A field out of range takes its default and the
   others are kept.
5. **Lists:** `palette`, `chord_sound` and `bass_sound` are checked against the lists by the glue.

Migrations by version (the `in.version < CRS_VERSION` block): v1 → 2 the metronome fields and the loop slot take
their defaults; v2 → 3 `pick_roots`; v3 → 4 the USB settings (`usb_in` on, `usb_level` Master; the zeros there would
switch the recording off); v4 → 5 the USB playback is removed: `rsv_usb` (v4's `usb_out`) is cleared, `usb_in` and
`usb_level` are kept; v5 → 6 presets per engine (docs/PRESETS.md): `chord_sound` / `bass_sound` (old list positions)
read as the defaults, every `pool_pos` 1.

## How to add a field

1. Take its bytes from the front of `rsv` in `cr_settings.h` and shrink `rsv` by that many. `CRS_SIZE` never
   changes, and the build checks it (`crs_size_ok`).
2. Bump `CRS_VERSION`.
3. Set its default in `cr_settings_defaults`, and its range in `crs_sanitize` (`CRS_FIX`).
4. If an older record's bytes there are not zero, or zero is not the default, add a line to the
   `in.version < CRS_VERSION` block of `cr_settings_import`: `if (in.version < 2) s->x = d.x;`.
5. If the field is the engine's, map it in `cr_settings_apply` / `cr_settings_capture`. If it is the UI's, map it
   in `crs_capture` / `cr_settings_load` (the glue part of `cr_settings.c`).
6. Add a check to `tests/cr_settings_test.c`.

Never reorder or remove a field. A retired field stays in place, unused.

## Runtime

| call | where | does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cr_settings_boot()` | `persist_boot` (cr_shim.c), the emulator's `emu_fw_init` | the flash object → Felucca's fields (panel table, palette, HOLD, LEDs) + the block; the USB settings to `usb.c` (`ua_off`) and `fx.c` (`fx_usb_fixed`) through `crs_usb_apply`, before `usb_start` builds the configuration the computer first reads |
| `cr_settings_load()` | the end of `cr_ui_init` (**patch below**); the emulator calls it after `cr_ui_init` until then | the block → engine (IRQ off), `cr_route`, the UI mirror `cs`, motion, palette, the sounds, tempo |
| `cr_settings_poll()` | every frame (`main.c` `settings_poll` → cr_shim.c; the emulator's `emu_fw_frame`) | captures the state; a change is written once nothing changed for 1.5 s and nothing has sounded for 1 s (no voice of the parts, no chord held or latched, no scheduled note, the master output under -60 dBFS: a flash erase stops the audio for ~45 ms, docs/INTEGRATION.md Performance), never while a loop plays (`CR_SETTINGS_BUSY()`), retried 1 s after a flash error, and skipped when the bytes are unchanged |
| `cr_settings_save()` | `settings_save` (cr_shim.c): the power-on calibration, Options | save now |

Saving is driven by change detection, so `cr_ui.c` needs no save call at each setting. The only call it needs
is the load at init. **The patch for `cr_ui.c`**, at the end of `cr_ui_init()`, after `cu_set_tempo(...)` and
before `song.grid = 2;`:

```c
#if CR_HAVE_SETTINGS
    cr_settings_load();                           /* the saved settings over the defaults (docs/SETTINGS.md) */
#endif
```

`cr_settings_load` is defined after `cr_ui.c` in the unit, so `cr_ui.c` also needs a forward declaration near
its top: `static void cr_settings_load(void);`. That declaration must sit inside the same `#if CR_HAVE_SETTINGS`.
The emulator does not define `CR_HAVE_SETTINGS`; there it includes `cr_settings.c` from `emu_fw.c`. Once the
patch is in, define `CR_HAVE_SETTINGS 1` in `emu_firmware.h` too, or keep the emulator's guard: `emu_fw_init`
calls `cr_settings_load()` only `if (!crs_loaded)`.

## Power-on calibration

OCT− + OCT+ held at power-on still runs Felucca's HARDWARE CALIBRATION:

- In the ChoralRoot unit, `main.c` has its own port, `cr_panel_setup`, because `ui_input.c` is not in the unit.
  `main.c`'s `#define panel_setup cr_panel_setup` picks it, so cr_shim.c's empty stub goes unused.
- `settings_save` then writes the table into the same record.

## The emulator's flash

`tools/emu/emu_hal_fw.h` holds the 1 MiB NOR as a RAM image backed by a file. It is read at power-on, and every
erase and program is written through to the file, so a crash or kill keeps what was saved. NOR rules apply:

- an erase sets a 4 KiB sector to 0xFF;
- a program only clears bits and must not wrap a 256-byte page.

`emu_fw.c` builds Felucca's `storage.c` and `cr_settings.c` on it with `FELUCCA_FLASH 1`. The rest of the UI is
still built RAM-only by `emu_firmware.h`.

| option | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--flash PATH` | the image file (default `build/emu/flash.bin` in windowed runs) |
| (headless) | no file unless `--flash` is given: every scripted run starts fresh and stays deterministic |
| `--no-flash` | RAM only |
| `--save-on-exit` | save the settings at exit, without waiting for the 1.5 s quiet time |

`emu_fw.c` takes these options out of `argv` before `emu.c` parses them; they become `--demo`, which ChoralRoot
ignores. The dump (F12 / `dump`) prints the flash file, the number of writes and saves, and whether the record
read as current, migrated or defaults.

`sh tools/emu/test_persist.sh` checks it end to end:

1. SELECT +17 sets 137 BPM; the script waits, quits, and the record is saved once.
2. A relaunch on the same file reads 137 BPM. The BPM meter is captured to `build/emu/test/persist_bpm.ppm`.
3. A run without `--flash` reads 120 BPM.
4. VA: a deep edit saved to U01; the relaunch powers on with U01 and its patch CRC as saved.
5. The picker's roots: KNOB 4 in the picker sets them to play; the relaunch opens the picker with them playing.
