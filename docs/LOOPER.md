# ChoralRoot FM-1 — the looper

`firmware/src/cr_loop.[ch]` (portable C99, no libc, no allocation; host tests `tests/cr_loop_test.c`), driven by
`cr_out.c` in the audio ISR and by `cr_ui.c` (gestures, screens, LEDs, flash slots). Grid reference:
`d_cr_loop.lua`, `d_cr_slots.lua`, `design.md` §14.

## What is recorded

A **semantic event** per chord gesture, written when the gesture ends (or when the capture ends with it held):

| field | bits | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `t` | u16 | on time, ticks from the loop start |
| `dur` | u16 | length in ticks (>= 1) |
| `root` | u8 | absolute resolved root (transpose and Key Mode applied: the recorded harmony) |
| `vel` | u8 | 1..127 |
| `qx` | u8 | quality (CR_Q_*) << 4 \| extension mask (CR_EXT_*) — the *final* chord (Advanced / Free) |
| `layer` | u8 | RAM only; in flash layers are counts |

Capture comes from the engine's `cr_out_t.gesture` hook (keyed voices and pads; a same-root retrigger ends one
gesture and starts another). Playback calls `cr_loop_event(c, lv, root, q, ext, vel, on)`: a resolved chord on one
of `CR_MAX_LOOPV` (8) loop voices, bypassing the chord-key state machine; voicing, performance, bass apply live.

## Timing

- Ticks: 96 per quarter note at the engine's BPM, accumulated from the ms clock with the remainder kept
  (no drift). A BPM change changes the loop's speed, never its pitch. Bar = 384 (4/4) or 288 (3/4, 6/8) ticks.
- **Free**: REC arms; the first chord starts the take; REC or LOOP ends it (length = elapsed, 24..65535 ticks).
- **1/2/4/8/16 bars**: REC starts a one-bar count-in (clicked; KNOB 3 turns it off), then records the sync length
  and commits by itself. REC/LOOP earlier: the length rounds up to whole bars.
- The take is the first cycle: playback continues seamlessly from the commit.
- **Overdub**: REC while playing (or stopped with a loop: it starts) arms; the next chord opens a layer whose times
  are cycle-relative; REC ends it, LOOP ends it and stops. Empty layers are discarded.
- **Quantize** (KNOB 2: none, 1/4, 1/8, 1/8T, 1/16, 1/16T, 1/32) moves note-ons to the nearest grid point at commit;
  note-offs stay (>= 1 tick); a note-on rounded past the end goes to 0.
- **Undo** (REC held, F#4 in the layer): the overdub in progress, else the last layer (the first stays: CLEAR).
- **Clear**: D#4 held 1 s in the LOOP layer. **Panic**: stops, keeps the loop; a fresh take is dropped, a partial
  overdub kept. **Level** (KNOB 4) scales the loop's velocities (0 = mute).
- **Metronome**: METRO tap = click on/off (on the take's / the loop's / its own grid), held = 4/4 3/4 6/8 picker,
  KNOB 1 there or OPT + SELECT = click level. The click is a 25 ms two-pole sine burst mixed after fx.c (cr_out.c
  `cr_click_mix`), 2.5 kHz on the bar's first beat.

## Gestures and screens (`cr_ui.c`)

| gesture | stopped | playing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LOOP tap | play (a take: commit) | stop |
| LOOP held | a knob row (layers sheet state 6, no ring): the **loop length** picker (Free 1 2 4 8 16 bars, red, "loop length") over Sync / Quantize / Count-in / Level | the Overdub / Pause / Undo / Clear picker ("loop N"), Sync dim; the corner dial in the top line |
| LOOP held + KNOB 1 (SYNC) or SELECT | moves the length picker (its slide; no meter) | moves the action picker |
| LOOP held + KNOB 2 / 3 / 4 | quantize / count-in / loop level: the cell hot 800 ms, no popup | the same |
| LOOP held + OCT+ | — | does the picked action |
| LOOP held + white root / D#4 held 1 s / F#4 | slot load / clear / undo | slot at the end of the cycle / clear / undo |
| REC tap | arm (Free) or count-in (synced) | overdub arm / end |
| REC held | undo: the layers left huge in red ("layers · undo"); none: "nothing to undo" | the same |

The count-in takes the whole panel: the beats to go (4 3 2 1 from the time signature) huge in red, each springing
in, "count-in" under it, the top line `Rec`, the red ring drawing itself in over the bar. It is above popups and
layers, below PANIC.

Where the loop is the subject — the count-in, the undo screen, recording and overdubbing (REC blinks) — Orchid's red
ring runs round the edge (calibration uses it too, as its progress). The LOOP and SAVE layers have no ring (the layers
sheet's state 6, 2026-10-07): a playing loop shows there as the dial like everywhere else. While the loop **merely plays** (or plays with an overdub
armed) the screen shows a small **corner dial** in the top line instead (`design/choralroot-fm1-loop-screens.png`):
a 16 px dial at the right end, the dotted track grey, the loop's progress red from 12 o'clock, its arc drawn thick
for ~100 ms on each downbeat (not with Options > Motion Off); the top line's right text ("Oct +1", "Arp") moves left
of it. It shows on the views, the layers (KEY, PERF, FX, BASS, LOOP, SAVE, METRO, the engine picker), the SAVE naming dialog
and the knob popups; not in the sound editor (no top line) nor on the Options pages, where the LOOP button's green
LED carries it.

While the loop sounds, its notes glow **dim** on the root keys where they sit in the current octave window
(`cr_snap_t.lnote`, a 128-bit note mask from the 8 loop voices, taken with the snapshot); the player's own notes stay
lit, and a chord shown on screen that is the loop's lights nothing. With Options > LEDs = Glow every idle key glows
dim anyway, so the glow is visible with LEDs = Stock (idle keys lit, the loop's dim): `tools/emu/scripts/cr_loop_glow.txt`.

With Options > MIDI Clock = Out (the default) the ISR sends 0xFA (start) when the loop starts playing (LOOP from
stopped, a take committed into playback) and 0xFC (stop) when it stops, USB MIDI CIN 0x0F; the 0xF8 pulses run as
before, restarting their phase at the start.

With MIDI Clock = In the loop follows the other way (cr_out.c `cr_in_transport`): 0xFA starts it from its start
(restarts it if playing), 0xFB plays it if stopped, 0xFC stops it; a take in progress is left alone, an empty loop
ignores them, and nothing is sent out.

## Slots and the record

Ten slots; only the selected one lives in RAM. LOOP held + a white root D4..F5 selects a slot (load when stopped,
at the end of the cycle when playing). SAVE held: Save / Load / Delete on the root-chosen slot, OCT+ does it. No
flash erase while a loop plays (Felucca's rule): a save then waits for the stop. The selected slot is a setting
(record v2) and comes back at power-on.

Flash: storage.c's commit record and A/B copies (its hooks, header and CRC; `storage.c` unedited), on user
sample slot 3's 80 KiB (0xC8000..0xDBFFF; ChoralRoot has no SAMPLE engine (`FELUCCA_SAMPLE 0`) and its backup no
sample objects, so nothing else writes it; a Felucca build's `eng_sample.c` ignores non-sample data): slot k copy c at `0xC8000 + (2k + c) * 4 KiB`, header type `0x4C30 + k`. Payload (little-endian):

```
0  u32 "CRL1"   4 u8 version 1   5 u8 sig   6 u8 nlayers   7 u8 0
8  u32 len (ticks)   12 u16 nev   14 u16 ppqn (96)
16 nlayers x u16: events per layer, then nev x 7 bytes: t u16, dur u16, root, vel, qx
```

Unpack checks everything (magic, version, ppqn, counts, each field's range) and refuses a bad record as empty: a
newer version or garbage never loads half a loop.

## Caps

512 events per loop (all layers; 4 KiB in RAM + a 4 KiB staging copy for slot switches; 3.6 KiB record),
32 layers, 16 open gestures, 8 loop voices, 65535 ticks. Reaching the event cap ends the take ("loop full").
